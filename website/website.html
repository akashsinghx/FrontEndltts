      <h2>History of Indian Premier League ( IPL )</h2>
      
      <p> In April 2008, the first session of IPL was started which was the idea of Lalit Modi, BCCI Vice president of that time. To decide the owners for a team there was an auction in January 2008 which cost around $400 Million.
        
        At the end of Auction, all franchises were sold at $723.59 and a total of eight teams came up with the names of cities. Bangalore, Chennai, Delhi, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Jaipur, Mohali and Mumbai.
        
        Before the fourth season of IPL, two new teams joined the tournament. Pune Warriors India and Kochi Tuskers Kerala. Pune Warriors franchise was bought at $370 and Kochi Tuskers Kerala was bought at $333.
        
        Format of IPL :
        
        There are a total of eight teams, each team plays with another team twice. In these two matches, one is played on the home ground of one team and other is played on another team.
        
        With eight teams, the total number of matches played is 56. Two points allocated for a winning team. The top four teams who have maximum points qualify for the playoffs.
        
        In the playoffs, the top two teams will play against each other to qualify for the final. Bottom two teams will play against each other and the loser of this match will be eliminated from the tournament.
        
        Now, the loser of top teams and winner of the bottom two teams will play against each other and that decides the second finalist of IPL.
        
        Prize Money :
        
        In the latest season of IPL, total prize money of $500 MIllion offered in which a winning team got $200 Million, First runner up got $125 Million and second runner up received $87.5 Million.
</p>
      <br>
      <h2>Match rules</h2>
     
      <p>
        IPL games utilise television timeouts and hence there is no time limit in which teams must complete their innings. However, a penalty  may be imposed if the umpires find teams misusing this privilege. Each team is given a two-and-a-half-minute "strategic timeout" during each innings; one must be taken by the bowling team between the ends of the 6th and 9th overs, and one by the batting team between the ends of the 13th and 16th overs.

        Since the 2018 season, the Umpire Decision Review System is being used in all IPL matches, allowing each team one chance to review an on-field umpire's decision per innings.
       </p>
       
      <p> The International Cricket Council (ICC) is the world governing body of cricket. It was founded as the Imperial Cricket Conference in 1909 by representatives from Australia, England and South Africa. It was renamed as the International Cricket Conference in 1965, and took up its current name in 1989. It organises world championship events such as World Test Championship, Cricket World Cup, Women's Cricket World Cup, ICC T20 World Cup, ICC Women's T20 World Cup, ICC Champions Trophy and Under-19 Cricket World Cup.</p>
